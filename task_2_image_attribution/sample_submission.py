"""
Example submission script for the IAR Attribution Task.

Submission Requirements (read carefully to avoid automatic rejection):

1. CSV FORMAT
----------------
- The file **must be a CSV** with extension `.csv`.
- It must contain **exactly two columns**, named:
      image_name, label
  → Column names must match exactly (lowercase, no extra spaces).
  → Column order does not matter, but both must be present.
  → Both columns must be string-typed (pandas `string` or `object` is fine).

2. ROW COUNT AND FILENAMES
-----------------------------
- Your file must contain **exactly 8,000 rows**.
- Each row corresponds to one unique `image_name` present in the official ground truth.
- Every `image_name` from the ground truth must appear **exactly once** in your CSV.
- Do **not** add, remove, or rename any `image_name` values.
- Do **not** include duplicates or missing entries.

3. LABEL VALUES (CASE-SENSITIVE)
---------------------------------
- Each `label` must be **exactly one** of the following allowed classes (case-sensitive):

  [
    "outlier",
    "VAR",
    "RAR",
    "Taming"
  ]

- Do not use aliases, capitalization changes, or extra spaces (e.g., "Outlier", "var", "RAR ", "taming" will be rejected).
- Each prediction must be exactly one of the above labels.

4. TECHNICAL LIMITS
----------------------
- Maximum file size: **10 MB**
- Encoding: **UTF-8** recommended.
- Avoid formulas, extra columns, hidden columns, BOM headers, or blank lines.
- Ensure both columns are strings (if needed: `df = df.astype({"image_name": "string", "label": "string"})`).

5. VALIDATION SUMMARY
------------------------
Your submission will fail if:
- Columns don’t match exactly `["image_name", "label"]`
- Row count differs from **8,000**
- Any `image_name` is missing or duplicated
- Any unexpected `image_name` appears (i.e., not in ground truth)
- Any `label` is outside the allowed set `{"outlier","VAR","RAR","Taming"}`
- File is too large or not a CSV
- CSV cannot be parsed
